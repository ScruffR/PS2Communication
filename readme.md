  PS2Communication.h - PS2Communication library
  Copyright (c) 2009 Free Software Foundation.  All right reserved.
  Rewritten for interrupt and ported for Spark Core and Particle.io devices
  like Photon and Electron by Andreas Rothenw√§nder (aka ScruffR)
  based on some non-interrupt library from pjrc.com (Paul Stoffregen)

  This library provides the basic PS/2 communication framework for
  sending single byte "commands" and receiving data/responses of a 
  PS/2 device.
  One example for communication between Spark Core and a PS/2 mouse is
  provided along with the library.
